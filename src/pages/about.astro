			<h1 class="title">About me</h1>
			<p>
				My journey is a little different than most. At the age of 13, I had grand plans of becoming
				a software engineer, and soon I began teaching myself how to code. During high school, I had
				chance to learn programming in depth. After that, I started building websites and apps and
				realized that I wanted to build startups, so I dropped out of university. Fast forward a few
				years and I'm a founder, software engineer, and maker.
